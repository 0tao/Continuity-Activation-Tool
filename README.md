Continuity Activation Tool
==========================

This tool makes the necessary changes to enable OS X 10.10 Continuity on compatible hardware. Continuity features activated by this tool include Application Handoff, Instant Hotspot, and Airdrop iOS<->OSX. 

## Features
* Activate continuity: Does a Continuity compatibility check, backups the original Systems kexts, disables a Mac-model blacklist in the Buetooth kext, whitelists the Mac board-id in the Wi-Fi kext.
* System diagnostic: Produces a report of the current system parameters influencing Continuity.

**Warning:** Users should exercise caution when using the Continuity Activation Tool, as it moves around low level files and there's a possibility it could cause problems. A backup is recommended before attempting to use the tool.

## Compatibility list
Your Mac might need a hardware upgrade in addition to the software patch to be able to work with Continuity. The table below is based on this [guide (forum thread)](http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=20124161). If you notice inaccuracies, please open an issue or report it to the guide author.

## How to use it

**From Finder**

1. Download the ZIP (link on the right) and extract it.
2. Run the app. _Note_: The current user must have admin privileges.
3. Follow the instructions on the screen. Ignore or deny any "Access to accessibility features" prompt.

**From the command line**
The script can also be run right from the command line. It is located in Continuity Activation Tool.app/Contents/MacOS/contitool.sh

Usage example: "./contitool.sh activate"

Script arguments: 
* activate : Starts the activation procedure and does compatibility checks.
* diagnostic : Starts the system compatibility diagnostic.
* forceHack : Starts the activation procedure and skips compatibility checks.

When using the script from the command line, make sure you have the strings binary in the same directory as the script OR, if you have Apple's Command Line Tools installed, edit contitool.sh and set stringsPath="strings".
